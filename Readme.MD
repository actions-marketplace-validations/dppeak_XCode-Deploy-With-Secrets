# XCode-Deploy 1.5
This action will archive, export, and upload your project or workspace to App Store Connect (TestFlight). 
It is designed to run on a containerized VM, such as a GitHub Hosted Runner.
If self-hosting, some of these steps may be unnecessary or redundant. 

## Inputs

### `xcode-version`

The version of XCode to use, in SemVer. Default is latest stable release: `xcode-latest`. See also [setup-xcode][0].

### `configuration`

The configuration to archive. Default is `Release`. See also `xcodebuild`'s `-configuration`. 

### `scheme`

The scheme to archive. If left blank, the action will search the project or workspace file for a default scheme. See also `xcodebuild`'s `-scheme`.

### `path-to-export-options`

The path to the `ExportOptions.plist` file, required for `-exportArchive`. Will default to `ExportOptions.plist` in the `${{ github.workspace }}` directory. See also `xcodebuild`'s `-exportArchive`.

### `json-for-plist-updates`

JSON string structured as an array of key/value pairs.  If left empty, the plist update action portion of the action will not run.

### `path-to-info-plist`

The path to the `Info.plist` file.  If left empty, the plist update action portion of the action will not run.

### `update-build`

A boolean value that will set the `version-number` to the commit depth.  If false, nothing happens. See also `agvtool`'s `-new-version`.

### `install-pods`

A boolean value that will run `pod install` if true.  If false, nothing happens.

### `resolve-package-dependencies`

A boolean value that will run `xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies -clonedSourcePackagesDirPath .` if true.  If false, nothing happens.

### `distribution-certificate-p12`

The `base64` representation of your Apple/iOS Distribution Certificate and private key pair. 

### `distribution-certificate-password`

The password to unlock the Distribution Certificate and private key pair.

### `app-store-provisioning-profile`

The `base64` representation of your App Store Provisioning Profile. 

### `auth-key-id`

The ID of the Authentication Key provided by App Store Connect.

### `auth-key-issuer-id`

The Issuer ID provided by App Store Connect.

### `auth-key-p8`

The `base64` representation of the private key provided by App Store Connect.

Additionally, an `ExportOptions.plist` file must be included in the repository at the location and filename that matches `path-to-export-options`.
You can generate one of these by doing a local export in XCode and then copy it into your repository, or use `/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy`.
